# First things to try

## Standalone work in progress: D05 #49

[PR #180](https://github.com/carloshm91/kuberich/pull/180) merged as `a4e958c`
on 2026-10-10 and closed #109. All four original required native environments,
Repository checks and DCO passed; original artifact/aggregate and owned-cluster
evidence was reviewed. The separate qualification finding under #40 remains open.

D05 now prepares Linux/macOS x86_64/arm64 executables. The new runtime launcher
re-executes the frozen application for its owned embedded PTY child and restores
external tools' library environment without changing the main process or captured
context. The focused source command was:

```sh
uv run --no-sync pytest -q tests/unit/test_runtime.py tests/unit/test_pty_boundary.py tests/unit/test_processes.py tests/contract/test_processes.py tests/contract/test_credentials.py tests/ui/test_embedded_terminal.py --cov=kuberich.runtime --cov-branch --cov-report=json:artifacts/standalone49/focused-runtime-coverage.json --cov-report=term-missing
```

It passed 219 cases on Linux/Python 3.12.12. Coverage of the new runtime module
alone was 100% lines/branches; full production/changed-line qualification is still
required. Ruff and strict mypy passed for the selected source/tool scope.

An exploratory PyInstaller 6.22.3 build used a separate environment containing
locked runtime/freezer dependencies and the actual built wheel. Its version/help
and valid-preference `info` ran outside the checkout with an empty PATH. The first
`info` fixture explicitly named a missing preference file and correctly exited 3;
that original result is retained separately from the corrected valid fixture.
This is local smoke evidence, not clean-host/minimum-OS or four-target qualification.
The actual copied frozen executable also passed three original owned-API/PTY
scenarios outside the checkout: repeated successful shell sessions, Unicode/
cursor/alternate-screen protocol and resize, and deliberate closure. Terminal
mode, cursor and reporting modes were restored; the fake external helper rejected
leaked frozen loader state. That helper deliberately uses the test host's Python,
so these cases establish the frozen application's launcher/UI behavior, not an
interpreter-free host or a real cloud-provider trial.

The native archive recipe now retains original dependency/build-tool notices,
CPython's license, copied system-library copyrights and the exact wheel,
source-input, file and archive hashes. The focused archive/notice checks passed
41 cases with:

```sh
uv run --no-sync pytest -q tests/quality/test_standalone_archive.py tests/quality/test_standalone_build.py
```

The actual diagnostic archive was validated and extracted outside the checkout.
Its frozen UI/PTY passed three scenarios and a fourth run with a compatible
modified Pyte source. The original Pyte source matched the installed wheel and
was absent from the embedded PYZ, so replacement used the external library.
These trials still use owned synthetic APIs and the host's Python helper.
The developer-host archive requires GLIBC 2.38, above the declared 2.35 floor:
it is explicitly diagnostic and cannot be a qualified release input. Builds
on the minimum supported Linux environment and the other native targets remain
pending. The first recipe attempt failed while parsing uv's generated comment
header; its original log is retained, and the export now excludes that header.
The first minimum-floor container lacked the documented development gate
dependencies and exited before the recipe started. The second reached the recipe
but its sanitized subprocess could not rediscover an interpreter installed in an
owned nondefault directory. Original logs are retained; wheel construction and
lock export now receive the already-selected interpreter explicitly, without
re-enabling ambient Python settings or downloads.
The next container built the native executable but package-notice collection
failed because dpkg recorded `/lib` while the resolved file lived under `/usr/lib`.
Notice discovery now checks the original source path and verified merged-/usr
aliases, rejecting missing or ambiguous owners. The failed original remains
retained; this does not waive notice or minimum-floor qualification.
Standalone downloads and public installation remain unavailable. No maintainer
trial or publication is requested at this checkpoint.

## Completed Q03 and resumed CI observation: Refs #50 / #109

[PR #179](https://github.com/carloshm91/kuberich/pull/179) merged as `f5933bb`
on 2026-10-10 after all four required native checks and independent original
artifact review. Q03 #50 is closed and its project card is Done. Linux Python
3.12/3.13/3.14 each passed 4,437 cases; macOS passed 4,434 plus three explicit
Linux-only skips. Measured coverage was at least 99.065732% lines and
96.845600% branches across all 109 production modules, with all 43 critical
modules at 100%. Changed executable production coverage was N/A (0/0).

Each of the four lifecycle/protocol scenarios passed 36 measured cycles per
native environment, with all 121 inputs matched to the frozen Git source,
stable descriptor/thread counts, no pending tasks, reaped forwarding children,
bounded history and actual 410/relist/current-row recovery. The exact focused
command was `uv run pytest -q tests/contract/test_performance_lifecycle.py`;
the complete native command was
`uv run pytest --cov=kuberich --cov-branch --cov-report=term-missing --cov-report=xml --cov-report=json`.
The original Linux 3.12 evidence also passed all 13 owned-cluster/installed-guide
steps; independent review verified 12 cluster receipts and the exact-wheel
quickstart with zero publications. Source, installed-runtime, audit, terminal
and static-site checks passed. This is PR qualification, not the full
six-environment release matrix.

This checkpoint also records #109's resumed hosted-usage observation. Its
read-only collection preserves 227 actual run/job records and failures, reproduces
the earlier 128-run totals and verifies the seven-native-job PR/main pattern on
identical source trees. See [the measured comparison](acceptance/private-ci.md).
The older post-PR178 main run `38077802296` failed its positive aggregate-runtime
child at 159.900812 ms during a warm resource route, above the unchanged
150-ms heartbeat limit; the parent's refill assertion obscured that earlier
failure. Original logs and artifact are retained, and the qualification finding
is tracked in [D04 #40](https://github.com/carloshm91/kuberich/issues/40#issuecomment-6101596974).
A later passing run does not establish a source correction. Q03's separately
qualified 30-minute p95/memory and lifecycle scope remain recorded below.

The first public target remains 0.1.0. Installation/upgrade, standalone outputs,
shell history and final qualification/activation gates remain open. No maintainer
trial, tag, package, tap, new site or DNS publication is requested here.

## Merged combined-load baseline: Refs Q03 #50

[PR #178](https://github.com/carloshm91/kuberich/pull/178) merged as `e095b28`
on 2026-10-10 after independent original-artifact review. Linux Python
3.12/3.13/3.14 each passed 4,432 cases; macOS passed 4,429 plus three explicit
Linux-only observer skips. Coverage measured at least 99.08% lines, 96.84%
branches and 96.15% changed lines, with all 43 critical modules at 100%.
Original package/installed-runtime/terminal/audit and owned-kind evidence passed;
Repository evidence binds 140 Git inputs and 49 desktop plus 49 mobile pages.

This baseline matches all 163 inputs of the original 30-minute combined-load
observation: 99.077-ms input-to-painted-tail p95 and the declared memory plateau.
The narrow reference-machine margin and original artifacts remain documented
below. This qualifies the required PR matrix, not the six-environment release.
The next PR adds only lifecycle/protocol tests and qualification documentation;
its full native evidence is required before Q03 closes.

## Owned lifecycle verification in progress: Refs Q03 #50

The new cleanup cohort passed five focused cases in each actual local Python
3.12, 3.13 and 3.14 interpreter. Each scenario has 36 measured cycles after
warmup: context switches stop real forwarding children, slow large-watch sinks
keep one parser operation, and repeatedly cancelled startup cleans private files
and processes. Descriptor/thread counts stay constant, pending tasks return to
zero and retained forwarding history stops at 32 records. An actual extra
descriptor, thread and task verifies that the observer detects each increase.
Its additional stalled-snapshot case forces a real 410 from the bounded local
source and verifies ordinary ListWatch relisting and current-row recovery.
The exact tested command was:

```sh
uv run pytest -q tests/contract/test_performance_lifecycle.py
```

Full native CI for these new sources remains required. See the
[measured scope and original failed probe](acceptance/combined-workload-progress.md#repeated-owned-lifecycle-cohort).
Q03 remains open; the maintainer need not repeat these automated trials.

## Latest verified baseline and sustained candidate: Refs Q03 #50

[PR #177](https://github.com/carloshm91/kuberich/pull/177) merged as `498711a`
on 2026-10-10. Its original four required native environments passed 4,428
cases on each Linux Python version and 4,425 on macOS, with three explicit
Linux-only observer skips. Independently reviewed coverage measured at least
99.08% lines, 96.82% branches and 97.35% changed lines, with all 43 critical
modules at 100%. Packaging, installed uv/pipx contracts, terminal restoration,
runtime controls and both static-site checks passed. This is PR qualification;
the six-environment release matrix remains separate.

The subsequent frozen incremental-log candidate `30b6856` completed the
30-minute combined workload: **99.077 ms p95**, 6,533 actual input-to-painted-tail
controls and 350 process samples. All 180,029 resource events and 3,600,580 log
lines were sent without source expiry. Independent review matched all 163 inputs
to Git and verified the original ANSI, memory rules and process/terminal cleanup.
Late-window CLI median RSS ranged from 162,460 to 162,544 KiB with constant
descriptors and threads. The source and observer also passed their memory rules.

The exact tested command on that frozen source was:

```sh
uv run python -m tests.support.performance_terminal --seconds 1800 --output artifacts/incremental50/frozen-30b6856-soak-original
```

The 100-ms target passed with a narrow 0.923-ms margin on the reference machine.
The next PR has the same production bytes as that original candidate; its native
checks remain required. Context churn, slow-consumer/cancelled-forward lifecycle
qualification and the remaining 0.1.0 installation/release gates stay open.
No maintainer trial, tag or public distribution is requested.

## Earlier baseline and combined-load work: Refs Q03 #50

[PR #176](https://github.com/carloshm91/kuberich/pull/176) merged as `9fa25c9`
on 2026-10-10 after independent review of its original four-native artifacts.
All four configured PR environments passed 4,382 cases; each measured at least
99.09% line and 96.90% branch coverage, 100% changed production lines and all 43
critical modules at 100%. These measured results belong to frozen PR source
`16fce8e`, with the same tree as the squash, and its actual tested merge checkout.
The exact full-suite and runtime-coverage commands were:

```sh
uv run pytest --cov=kuberich --cov-branch --cov-report=term-missing --cov-report=xml --cov-report=json
uv run python -m scripts.merge_runtime_coverage
```

[Application run 38058235753](https://github.com/carloshm91/kuberich/actions/runs/38058235753)
and [Repository run 38058235738](https://github.com/carloshm91/kuberich/actions/runs/38058235738)
passed. Original Linux 3.12 evidence includes all 11 owned-kind aggregate scenarios,
strict current/previous last-instance assertions and verified cluster deletion.
Repository evidence binds 140 Git source files and 49 desktop plus 49 mobile
browser pages. Earlier failed originals remain retained. This qualifies the
required PR matrix; the full six-environment release qualification remains open.

The next working candidate adds independently paced 10,000-Pod, 100-event/sec
and 2,000-log-line/sec inputs, 10,000-line/4-MiB retention, deferred covered-table
painting and bounded reusable log layouts. The reproducible observer selects the
last of the 10,000 Pods with native Ctrl+End; repeated target checks reuse only
the same immutable snapshot and retain every client/scope/generation guard.
Its latest 30-second normal CLI/PTY diagnosis measured **138.680 ms p95** across
101 actual painted-tail controls, with all 3,012 resource updates and 60,240 log
lines sent, no source expiry and seven process-memory/descriptor samples.
Both process owners drained normally and all 163 measured inputs were unchanged.
The original 30-minute observation on frozen `04871e5` then completed with
**168.227 ms p95** across 5,826 painted controls and 349 process samples. All
180,009 resource updates and 3,600,180 log lines were sent without source expiry.
Independent review matched all 163 inputs to Git, recomputed the distributions
and checked the original ANSI hash, bounded source and normal terminal/process
cleanup. The predeclared memory rule passed: the CLI's late-window RSS medians
were 159,824–160,072 KiB, with constant descriptors and threads. Source and
observer also passed their late-window rules. The exact tested commands were:

```sh
uv run python -m tests.support.performance_terminal --seconds 30 --output artifacts/workload50/last-pod-ctrl-end-original
uv run python -m tests.support.performance_terminal --seconds 1800 --output artifacts/workload50/frozen-04871e5-soak-original
```

Use a fresh output directory for another observation; existing originals are
never overwritten. Both input-response observations exceed the unchanged
100-ms target; only the sustained original establishes the measured memory
subset. The observer/negative-control
cohort passed 16 cases; membership, observer and inspection behavior passed
28 cases. The final generator/covered-view/layout/membership/observer cohort
passed 39 cases, Ruff checked 491 formatted files and strict types passed over
133 source files. These are scoped results for their recorded working inputs.
The original PR #177 native suite found a measurement-helper assumption: Python
3.13/3.14 have different ordinary GC thresholds from 3.12. The correction probes
the same executable's isolated default and still rejects disabled or tuned GC;
19 focused cases passed in each actual local 3.12/3.13/3.14 interpreter. The failed
originals remain retained; corrected full native qualification, latency,
context churn and cancelled-forward qualification remain pending under Q03.
Pod-table `G` is still tracked by B07 #61;
its failed setup observation and cleanup receipt are retained.
See [working evidence and limitations](acceptance/combined-workload-progress.md).

A subsequent local candidate reuses exactly matching retained geometry and
updates fixed-height log counters without recalculating the covered workspace layout.
Its first normal 30-second observation measured **91.190 ms p95 / 113 controls**,
with all 3,017 events and 60,340 log lines sent, unchanged measured inputs,
zero source expiry and normal terminal/process cleanup. This is a short working
observation, not sustained or native qualification. The exact tested command was:

```sh
uv run python -m tests.support.performance_terminal --seconds 30 --output artifacts/incremental50/normal-fixed-height-original
```

Twelve focused Rich/layout/cancellation cases passed after correcting search
match pruning for reordered retained entries. The original failing cases remain
retained. The complete owned log cohort then passed 36 cases in 223.20 seconds,
and exact workflow lint/format and strict types passed over 492 files and 133
source files. The later frozen sustained result is recorded above; native and
the remaining lifecycle qualification are still required.

The first public target remains 0.1.0. The `kuberich` GitHub organization now
exists; source remains `carloshm91/kuberich`, and `brew install kuberich/tap/kuberich`
is the intended unpublished channel. No source transfer, package, tap, tag or
release was performed. No intermediate maintainer trial is requested.

## Earlier native qualification and owned CrashLoop scenario: Refs Q03 #50

Earlier update: the `321e9ca` candidate also failed required real-kind
enrollment after all four PR suites passed 4,365 cases. Two subsequent local
fixture revisions remain unqualified. Owned status-timing evidence shows a
waiting observation can last only about 117 ms before running. The earlier
receipt-time window below does not lease container state across API calls;
its replacement still required qualification at that point.

The working correction now selects one unchanged actual waiting LIST response
at the membership boundary, then leaves later LIST/WATCH and every log request
ordinary. Its receipt labels that fixture control. First-instance, single-line,
no-replay and cleanup assertions remain enforced. Its 81 focused contracts and
all 11 real-kind scenarios passed, with unchanged caller configuration and
verified cluster deletion. Required strict types over 133 files and static-site
checks passed. Its later original native qualification is recorded above.
This does not add a user-facing feature or request another maintainer trial.

The dense-log candidate passed all 4,349 cases in four native environments.
Three complete jobs passed; Linux/Python 3.12 failed later because the owned
crashing container restarted before the waiting-instance log scenario enrolled.
Its expected output and normal reader completion did not satisfy that scenario.
The failed original remains retained and the candidate was not merged.

The corrected verifier observes an actual termination-to-waiting transition and
enrolls within its bounded receipt-time window. `uv run pytest -q
tests/quality/test_aggregate_kind.py tests/quality/test_owned_kind.py
tests/quality/test_ci_policy.py` passed 62 cases; the actual owned Kubernetes
trial passed 11 scenarios, including current/previous waiting-instance logs,
all-reader cleanup and verified cluster deletion. Required Ruff/format checks
and strict types over 133 files passed. New frozen native checks remain required.
See [evidence and limits](acceptance/owned-crashloop-window.md).

The first public target remains 0.1.0, with planned brand-owned installation
`brew install kuberich/tap/kuberich`. No version, tag, tap or package is published
by this correction; Q03's full sustained-load qualification remains open.

## Cooperative dense-log delivery: Refs Q03 #50

Pending input, cancellation and target changes now get a cooperative turn during
dense log delivery. Three HTTP regressions reproduced the preceding 4,096-line
delay; the correction checks each next target and yields after at most 32 lines,
preserving order, partial EOF, slow-consumer backpressure and response ownership.

`uv run --locked --python 3.12 pytest -q tests/unit tests/contract tests/ui/test_aggregate_logs.py tests/ui/test_logs.py tests/ui/test_sessions.py tests/quality/test_backend_runtime.py tests/quality/test_backend_heartbeat.py tests/quality/test_runtime_coverage.py --cov=kuberich --cov-branch`
passed 3,077 cases in 440.60 seconds. Eleven actual source-terminal cases passed
in 33.75 seconds; Python 3.13 and 3.14 each passed 149 focused cases. Four receipts
bind 537 unchanged tracked inputs. All 43 critical modules and 13 owned changed
executable lines measured 100% after the required runtime coverage verification/
merge. The scoped overall 89.2635% line / 86.6836% branch result does not qualify
whole-package floors; new frozen-head/native checks remain required.

Normal backend latency now has its own source-bound fresh positive and deliberate
200-ms blocking controls, while the full original 32,768-line HTTP workload stays
branch-covered in the parent suite. The controls measured 31.011 ms and failed
at 201.247 ms respectively, with complete line delivery and zero final owners/
streams/watches. Original macOS source `46c4dea` failed at 561.710 ms with CTracer
and the development IRI grammar loaded; a 534.620-ms GC collection overlapped it.
Those observations do not establish the whole cause or qualify the failed head.
All originals remain retained. See [exact evidence and limits](acceptance/cooperative-log-delivery.md).

Q03 remains open for combined independent load, 10,000 retained lines, sustained
input p95 below 100 ms, a 30-minute memory plateau and lifecycle qualification.
The first public target remains 0.1.0 and the planned brand-owned command remains
`brew install kuberich/tap/kuberich`. No package, tap, release or intermediate
maintainer trial is published/requested by this correction.

## Collected parser outcomes and bounded log formatting: Refs Q03 #50

Repeated parser cancellation now drains a collector before returning, including
late worker failures on Python 3.14. Uncancelled errors keep their original
identity. Aggregate layout/export formatting preserves the captured source,
order, timestamps and mode through sequential owned turns capped at 32 records
and 8 KiB, with one larger retained record isolated in its own turn.

`uv run --locked --python 3.12 pytest -q tests/unit tests/contract tests/ui/test_aggregate_logs.py tests/ui/test_logs.py tests/ui/test_sessions.py --cov=kuberich --cov-branch`
passed 2,992 cases in 396.92 seconds; 11 actual source-terminal cases passed in
33.82 seconds. Python 3.13 and 3.14 each passed the 209-case focused parser/
formatting cohort. Four receipts bind 532 unchanged source inputs, including all
109 production modules. After the required runtime replay coverage merge, all
43 critical modules and the 29 owned changed executable lines measured 100%.
The scoped suite's overall 89.2599% line / 86.6836% branch measurement does not
qualify the whole-package gates; full frozen-head/native checks remain required.

The ordinary runtime child completed both 5,000-record rounds at 113.758 ms,
below the unchanged 150-ms guard. Its deliberately blocking negative control
failed at 204.496 ms; the instrumented functional replay completed both rounds
and is not timing evidence. All three final application/API cleanup receipts
record zero owned viewers, log streams and watches.

The preceding `087ee65` native run failed: Python 3.14 exposed two late shield
error callbacks, and macOS measured 151.067 ms during round-two save. These
original failures remain retained; passing local checks do not qualify that
head or establish the complete cause of the macOS gap. See
[acceptance evidence](acceptance/owned-log-formatting.md).
The first public target stays 0.1.0 with the planned
`brew install kuberich/tap/kuberich` channel. No new ticket, version bump,
publication or intermediate maintainer trial accompanies this correction.

## Bounded aggregate input preparation: Refs Q03 #50

The runtime fixture refills the same 5,000 records through owned batches capped
at the product transport's 8-KiB read size. Its receipt verifies 230 batches,
22 records/8,184 bytes maximum per batch, both full-history rounds and the same
5,001 maximum retained-plus-prepared records. The 150-ms gate, ordinary GC,
warm navigation/resize/theme cycles and 200-ms blocking negative control remain.

`uv run pytest -q tests/ui/test_aggregate_logs.py tests/contract/test_aggregate_logs.py --cov=kuberich --cov-branch`
passed all 30 affected cases in 132.62 seconds. The final normal positive child
measured 114.769 ms, the required negative child failed at 206.152 ms, and the
instrumented functional replay completed both rounds. These local receipts bind
165 unchanged source inputs. New frozen-head/native checks remain required;
the original #176 macOS failure is retained and its cause is not established by
these later observations. See [input preparation evidence](acceptance/aggregate-input-preparation.md).

## Watch pipeline work: Refs Q03 #50

Live resource JSON and domain normalization share one owned worker per event.
Raw framing stays bounded; decoded transport compatibility, slow consumers,
Table fallback, retry/checkpoint semantics and safe errors are preserved.
`uv run pytest -q tests/contract/test_watch_pipeline.py tests/contract/test_watches.py tests/contract/test_resources.py tests/contract/test_custom_resources.py --no-cov`
passed all 188 focused cases, including 19 new HTTP/framing and repeated-cancel
cases. The broad affected cohort passed 557 contract/UI cases and 20 actual
source-terminal cases. All 25 owned changed executable lines measured 100%.
Frozen-head/native verification remains required.

A paired 30-second actual CLI/PTY resource-only diagnosis measured 141.081 ms
input-to-painted-selection p95 before the combined worker and 96.333 ms after.
These are working-source observations, not complete Q03 qualification. A
headless diagnosis still lagged the independent event source and had a long
heartbeat gap. A final-source actual CLI/PTY sample measured 80.443 ms p95 with
normal restoration/cleanup. Combined logs, 10,000-line retention, sustained throughput and
the 30-minute memory plateau remain open; no intermediate manual trial or
publication is requested. Exact source limits are in
[watch pipeline evidence](acceptance/watch-pipeline-performance.md).

The preceding PR #176 remains unmerged: its original macOS run
`38036838862` failed the aggregate runtime heartbeat during the second full-history
input delivery (165.123 ms against 150 ms; 4,267 passed/one failed). Its original
source, log and artifact remain preserved. Passing Linux jobs or local watch
checks do not qualify that failed candidate or establish the failure's cause.
All three original Linux environments independently passed 4,268 cases with
all 43 critical modules and 47 changed executable lines at 100%; minimum whole
line/branch coverage was 99.0944% / 96.8662%. Those environment-specific receipts
do not override the macOS failure or failed aggregate Quality gate.

## Owned workspace repaint work: Refs Q03 #50

Unchanged workspace labels avoid duplicate updates while identity/theme/style
changes still repaint. Resource tables reuse immutable projection rows and opt
into native row repaint for safe width-preserving edits; geometry changes and
unknown content retain full native behavior. The complete affected cohort passed
224 UI/domain cases and ten actual owned source-terminal cases. Final signed-head
native checks remain required before merging this candidate. Resource-only
terminal observations improved but still exceed Q03's
100-ms target; combined logs, sustained memory and lifecycle qualification remain
open. [Exact scope and observer limits](acceptance/live-render-performance.md)
retain the original evidence. No intermediate manual trial or publication is
requested.

## Resource ordering work: Refs Q03 #50

Pod, standard and discovered resource tables preserve their established order
through unrelated live edits, while repainting cells and retaining selection and
scroll. Changed typed values, identity ties, membership, native reorder, schema,
context and interrupted batches still receive canonical ordering. All 173
affected UI/domain cases and three owned source-terminal cases passed. The
critical Pod domain and all 43 changed executable production lines met 100%
coverage. PR #175 merged as `26ba91e5f03e04818fdc0c9343c2ae43b56a8832`
after all eight required checks and independent original artifact review. Each
of four development environments passed 4,246 cases; minimum whole line/branch
coverage was 99.0920% / 96.8856%, with all 43 critical modules and changed
executable lines at 100%. Exact evidence and continuing input/throughput/memory limits are in
[resource-order evidence](acceptance/table-order-performance.md). Q03 remains open,
and no intermediate manual maintainer trial or public publication is requested.

## Table responsiveness work: Refs Q03 #50

Header-bounded numeric resource updates avoid measuring an entire retained
column when public width metadata is still trustworthy. Native sizing remains
responsible for mutable/custom cells and deferred width changes. A new parity
case reproduced a deferred-update mismatch in the initial local candidate; the
corrected candidate passed all 95 affected UI cases and three actual owned
source-terminal cases. The affected module's 70 lines/14 branches and all 48
changed executable production lines measured 100%. PR #174 merged as
`4ca1369b099c9af8453eb3355ca8942812d2ffbc` after all eight required checks and
independent original artifact review. Each of the four development environments
passed 4,216 cases; minimum whole line/branch coverage was 99.0897% / 96.8785%,
with all 43 critical modules and changed executable lines at 100%. Python 3.14
counts two fewer pure annotation statements; independent compiler/parser
verification matched the original coverage inventories. Exact
commands and the source limits of earlier checks and diagnostic timings are in
[table-width evidence](acceptance/table-width-performance.md).

The 10,000-row diagnosis identified a useful hot path, but input responsiveness,
combined throughput, independent pacing, 10,000 retained logs and the 30-minute
memory plateau remain open in Q03. No intermediate manual trial is requested.
The first public phase remains 0.1.0, with `brew install kuberich/tap/kuberich` as
the project-owned channel proposal. No tag, package, organization/tap or new
site/DNS publication occurs here.

## Phased release preparation: Refs #89

The maintainer now targets first public **0.1.0**, followed by reviewed cumulative
0.x phases and stable 1.0 compatibility/audit. This supersedes the historical
#154 first-public-1.0-only direction below. Development metadata remains
`0.0.1.dev0`; no tag, application artifact, tap or new website was published by
this preparation. The source stays `carloshm91/kuberich`; the intended project
channel is `brew install kuberich/tap/kuberich`, pending actual organization
control and approved activation.

The full 79-task plan validates repository/issue identity, unknown/cyclic
references and every phase before issue requests. First 0.1 includes delivered
#53/#54 despite their original v0.2 grouping, plus #123 and D06's full D04/D05/Q03
prerequisites. Later phases require all prior gates; unknown minors fail. The live
preparation snapshot has six open prerequisites #150/#123/#40/#49/#51/#50, with
#89 as separate first activation. Actual manager upgrades are still required;
fresh install tests do not complete that contract. Authored notes and an optional
reviewed generated preview freeze to exact source/version/body bytes before
approval, without expanding validator permissions.

Current scoped local evidence: the final quality/packaging cohort passed all
735 cases in 713.59 seconds without failures/skips, including real-Git notes,
owned HTTP/TAP retries, actual artifact audits, isolated installers and CLI
preview env/file paths. Its 517-file source snapshot includes all 109 production
modules. Earlier 286-case and 32-case focused receipts remain retained. These are
working-source preparation receipts, not final-head native qualification. Local
build/Twine and site checks passed; Chrome checked 49 desktop and 49 mobile pages
with zero violations, failures or external requests, including keyboard, 320px,
clipboard and no-JavaScript controls. Node audit reported zero vulnerabilities.
Exact commands and remaining limits are retained
in [phase preparation acceptance](acceptance/phased-release-preparation.md).
Main and both `release`/`release-test` environments were independently re-read at
2026-10-10 02:09:56 UTC with enforced reviewed protection; no release dispatch was
performed. Existing gate/epic/milestone scope was reconciled and independently
re-read at 02:23:31 UTC (18 items, all open states preserved, no new tickets).
PyPI/TestPyPI ownership/OIDC, full six-native release qualification,
actual upgrades, public channels and approved final launch remain open in #89.

A later main-push run 38014888892 on the same merged #54 baseline ended FAILURE:
Linux 3.13 passed 4,091 cases but its separate tiny-line HTTP/retention contract
measured 175.396 ms against unchanged 150 ms; the Quality gate failed. Linux 3.12/
3.14 passed. A source-unchanged full-catalogue/selected-node diagnostic passed
under branch coverage with default GC but did not reproduce or explain the gap.
[Existing Q03 #50 records diagnosis](https://github.com/carloshm91/kuberich/issues/50#issuecomment-6092751782)
for remediation before first-phase qualification; there is no retry-only success
or new runtime change in this preparatory PR. Earlier #54 exact-head evidence
below stays historical and is not relabeled as qualification of this failed run.

## Native verification prerequisites: Refs #50 / #89

[PR #173](https://github.com/carloshm91/kuberich/pull/173) merged as
`6c5cb3e358b316feca4754de4ca977b1ef3ce984` after all required checks and an
independent review of the retained original artifacts. Its source
`e488919aa0d82254f055d99a8f07980e60aaa58a`, tested PR checkout
`a009c88e5a0d0c8ab0a127cc006e1e7a048b5d0b` and squash merge share tree
`f98a7acdfb84c9e89d420f49bc73dd3a89427d64`.

Exact commands included `uv run pytest --cov=kuberich --cov-branch
--cov-report=xml --cov-report=json`, followed by
`uv run python -m scripts.merge_runtime_coverage` and the independent coverage
and package gates in the configured workflow. Linux Python 3.12/3.13/3.14 and
macOS Python 3.12 each passed 4,100 cases. Minimum line/branch coverage was
99.0957% / 96.8679%; all 43 critical modules met 100%. Original reviews matched
109 production modules and all 111 payload files in each built distribution,
verified runtime positive/negative/functional coverage evidence, installed uv/
pipx artifacts, terminal restoration, dependency audits and local-only release
fixtures. Linux 3.12 also passed the configured owned-cluster rehearsals.

This delivers verification corrections and bounded backend diagnostics under the
unchanged workload, default GC and 150-ms assertion. It adds no new product
feature, does not establish the cause of the previous failed measurements and
does not complete Q03 or the full six-environment release qualification. The
earlier failed run remains preserved.
[Original native evidence and limits](acceptance/native-verification-prerequisites.md)
record the four successful development environments. No intermediate manual
maintainer trial or public artifact publication is required by this checkpoint.

[PR #172](https://github.com/carloshm91/kuberich/pull/172) subsequently merged as
`b6337977f6e72f8688a9efc3f8e8b875f10b7c4e` after all required checks and
independent review of the original native and Repository artifacts. Its source
`098e398fb704b277b6a7376062a9d651eb41a511`, actual tested PR checkout
`017a6de8969488a6a75f68685a29c3fa2eae0b2a` and squash merge share tree
`35df36db9e21409339ac99462e334bb68abc2037`. All four development environments
passed 4,185 cases; minimum line/branch coverage was 99.0787% / 96.8394%, with
all 43 critical modules at 100%. Original reviews verified production/package
source identity, runtime coverage, installers, terminal restoration and the
configured owned-cluster checks. Repository checks covered all 49 desktop and
49 mobile pages with zero violations or browser failures. This qualifies the
preparation change; it does not activate or publish a distribution channel.

## Aggregate logs checkpoint: S06 #54

Ordinary Pod/workload rows now open all-container logs with Shift+L or `:logsall`.
Lines retain namespace/Pod/container/UID identity; `c` selects at most eight
readers, `s` filters retained output without opening readers, and `J` selects
plain/JSON. Existing log navigation, windows, previous-instance, timestamps,
pause/follow, copy/save and Pod Enter→containers→selected logs remain available.
Workload membership follows controller UID chains; newly started regular/init/
ephemeral containers enroll without replaying ended streams. Generic routes
retain their read-only inspection contract.

Final #54 qualification is complete. [PR #171](https://github.com/carloshm91/kuberich/pull/171)
merged as `422c9464bad73ed83df713b709e3db70559f23a2`; tested source
`9be229bea98f498e1ee3f4a3ba28cabe7dd15327` and actual Actions checkout
`2b5c68dabcdd4e9a4929f0706b4ec51fe81e3015` have the same tree
`3858d1145546b1d88abcc51f91a95611fe7426d8` as that merge.
[Application run 38011954997](https://github.com/carloshm91/kuberich/actions/runs/38011954997)
and [Repository run 38011954992](https://github.com/carloshm91/kuberich/actions/runs/38011954992)
plus DCO passed all eight required checks. All four native environments passed
4,092 cases, independently verified whole/branch/changed coverage and every one
of 43 critical modules at 100%. The minimum measured coverage was 99.0787%
lines, 96.8394% branches and 98.27% changed lines. Runtime positive maximum gaps
were 108.395 ms (Linux 3.12), 77.865 ms (3.13), 51.904 ms (3.14) and 100.963 ms
(macOS 3.12), below the unchanged 150-ms bound, with both full-history rounds,
default GC and public cleanup. Each environment retained the deliberate failing
blocker and separate successful instrumented functional replay, exact 109-module
coverage union, packages/installers and six source/installed PTYs. Linux 3.12
passed all eleven aggregate-kind checks and deleted its owned cluster, including
separate current/Previous available-instance preconditions. Root independently
qualified original artifacts and preserved sign-off. This is development behavior
qualification, not full six-native release/provider/RSS qualification.

### Historical #54 diagnosis and local checkpoints

The receipts below preserve superseded source failures and scoped local results;
they do not replace the final exact-head qualification above.

Exact tested command:
`env COVERAGE_FILE=artifacts/aggregated-logs-54/final-focused.coverage uv run pytest -q tests/unit/test_aggregate_logs.py tests/unit/test_logs.py tests/contract/test_aggregate_logs.py tests/contract/test_logs.py tests/ui/test_aggregate_logs.py tests/ui/test_logs.py tests/terminal/test_aggregate_logs.py tests/packaging/test_distribution.py::test_installed_aggregate_logs_and_terminal_restore tests/quality/test_ci_policy.py --cov=kuberich --cov-branch`:
200 cases passed in 168.18 seconds, including source/fresh-installed real PTYs,
full retained-history heartbeat, JSON/clipboard/save, UID churn and context cleanup.
The separate 1,996-case pure suite passed in 41.13 seconds. Aggregate decisions
measure 207/207 lines and 68/68 branches. The latest decoder-boundary correction
passed 120 cases in 4.51 seconds, with JSON decisions 49/49 lines and 18/18
branches. A separate footer/lifecycle correction cohort passed 125 cases in
72.61 seconds, including all three source/fresh-installed aggregate PTYs.
`uv run python -m scripts.verify_aggregate_logs_kind --kind /PATH/TO/OWNED/kind`
passed eleven actual checks, including Pending/init→app and waiting CrashLoop
current/Previous enrollment without reopen, Deployment/CronJob ownership,
ephemeral sources, Pod replacement and drained
cleanup; its unique disposable cluster was deleted. These are local draft
receipts: final frozen source/platform/coverage/install qualification remains
required. The first frozen hosted source failed four existing header/terminal
cases because a thirteenth shortcut clipped Help; the paired `l/L` hint corrects
that regression without weakening the assertions. All four native jobs failed;
Linux 3.12 and 3.13 additionally exceeded the 150-ms full-history heartbeat
limit. Failed hosted and reproduced local sequences remain diagnostic evidence.
An intermediate layout retained styled segments and limited expensive visible
Strip caches to 128 entries. It preserved complete retained layouts and public
navigation. Earlier direct-Strip and fixture-isolation attempts still exceeded
150 ms; those failed receipts remain preserved. That lightweight layout passed
an ordinary Python 3.13 64-case sequence in 185.98 seconds at 120.06 ms, with
normal GC and the unchanged 150-ms limit.
The correction cohort passed sixteen layout/UI/source/fresh-installed PTY cases
in 79.72 seconds. Its Python 3.12 affected cohort passed 217 cases in
202.47 seconds, including sequential 5,000-record/control/replay cycles and
public Escape/drain at a 126.70-ms maximum heartbeat with normal GC enabled.
It also checks 15,000 delivered lines, 5,000 retained layouts, paging/cache bounds,
resize anchors and actual fresh Head-window text. Its actual hosted replacement
`23d0dfb` then failed Linux 3.12/3.13 at 238.49/207.72 ms; macOS 3.12 and Linux
3.14 passed. That source remains superseded, not qualified. The next correction
retains primitive text/cell-width/highlight descriptions and constructs actual
styled segments only for viewed rows, with the same 128-entry cache. Sanitized
aggregate projections also avoid redundant LogEntry/LogLine wrappers. Theme-only
color changes and folded Unicode highlights pass actual rendering probes. The
ordered full-catalogue diagnostic still failed at 182.36 ms with a 176.93-ms
generation-two collection during second-round mode/timestamp/copy. Its failed
receipt is preserved. The next narrow correction also avoids transient Rich
objects and span calculations for plain unwrapped rows. Ordered diagnosis still
failed at 182.63 ms, now at a Pilot callback allocation. Outside-measurement
attribution found development-only IRI grammar and pytest catalogue roots absent
from the installed runtime; all prior apps were gone. The reviewed required
fresh-process scenario retains the 150-ms/default-GC/two-full-round contract and
warms genuine same-app table/viewer/source-picker/theme/40+100-column caches.
Its first local pair measured 133.83 ms for the successful scenario and 207.54 ms
for a deliberate 200-ms callback that failed the exact heartbeat assertion; both
drained. That initial pair merged only its successful positive branch coverage.
The subsequent Python 3.12 cohort failed at 196.94 ms during warm
navigation (245 passed, one failed). Ordinary paired diagnosis measured 177.48 ms
with coverage's CTracer versus 112.49 ms uninstrumented, with identical controls
and default GC. Required runtime positive/negative checks now run uninstrumented;
a third mandatory full functional replay collects branch coverage, whose timing
is marked nonqualifying. Only that successful replay merges through
`uv run python -m scripts.merge_runtime_coverage` before unchanged coverage gates.
The required local Python 3.12 trio passed: runtime positive
113.04 ms/two full rounds, deliberate negative 204.65 ms/exact heartbeat failure,
and successful instrumented full replay with nonqualifying 176.11-ms timing.
All drained; the actual merge verified the 109-module parent/replay arc union.
The final Python 3.12 affected cohort passed all 258 cases in 290.09 seconds,
including source/fresh-installed terminals and the three-mode contract at a
115.74-ms runtime maximum. Its signed `b9ecbf3` replacement subsequently failed
required Linux 3.12 at 160.96 ms during warmed resource navigation, despite the
other three native environments passing. That source is unqualified and the
failed original receipts remain retained. A narrow table-rendering correction
now resolves the inherited style once per synchronous frame, preserving themes,
nested renders and visible output. Its ordinary Python 3.12 runtime/table cohort
passed four cases in 97.73 seconds: 112.73-ms positive/two rounds, a deliberate
201.31-ms negative heartbeat failure, and successful functional coverage replay.
The unchanged GC, warm-up, history and 150-ms bounds remain required. Fresh signed
source and full native qualification are still pending; local results do not
qualify a release. The broader affected cohort then passed 353 cases in 546.32 s,
including existing Pod/standard/custom table navigation and source/fresh-installed
terminals. Its runtime maximum was 103.87 ms across both full-history rounds;
the deliberate negative failed exactly at 205.98 ms, and the functional replay
completed with nonqualifying timing. The original logo-settle reflow regression
also passed separately. These remain local, precommit results.
The signed `dcde9d6` candidate then passed Linux 3.13/3.14 but failed macOS on a
real initial-table cursor race and Linux 3.12 during the later aggregate-kind
CrashLoop enrollment check. All original runtime controls passed; the candidate
remains unqualified. Public sort/cursor input is now preserved across the initial
batch yield and pending custom-layout restoration. Eight focused Python 3.12
cases and independent owned HTTP/Pilot reproductions pass. The original kind
timeout's cause remains unresolved; revised bounded per-mode diagnostics and
owned-instance preconditions preserve the original 120-second assertions without
changing transport or retries. Its local 11-check kind trial passed and deleted
the disposable cluster. Fresh final-head native checks are still required.
The broader selection cohort passed 356 cases, with a 118.34-ms uninstrumented
runtime maximum and complete ownership drain. Further independent public End
evidence demonstrated horizontal scroll returning to zero at the initial commit.
The correction now preserves cursor/sort/horizontal input through both that
commit and pending callbacks. Ten focused cases pass, including End/Right at
40×12 and existing UID/top/vertical-scroll and compatible-layout controls; a
fresh frozen matrix remains required.
The final affected cohort passed 358 cases in 522.88 s, with 118.67-ms runtime,
207.73-ms deliberate heartbeat failure and successful functional replay. The
verified 109-module coverage union and original child/parent receipts remain
separate from historical failures. The focused public-input verification command
was:

```sh
uv run --python 3.12 pytest \
  tests/ui/test_custom_resources.py::test_initial_projection_preserves_public_selection_between_batches \
  tests/ui/test_custom_resources.py::test_mixed_date_column_keeps_equal_timestamp_order_and_cursor_after_watch \
  tests/ui/test_standard_table.py tests/ui/test_custom_table.py \
  -q --tb=short --junitxml=artifacts/aggregated-logs-54/frame-failure/horizontal-complete312.xml
```

These are local working-source results; the next signed head must pass all fresh
required native checks before merge.
See
[controls and limits](log-viewer.md#all-container-and-workload-logs-s06-54)
and [acceptance evidence](acceptance/aggregated-logs.md). Embedded-shell
scrollback/search/copy qualification remains open in #123; no provider trial or
publication is part of this checkpoint.

## Generic resource browser checkpoint: B06 #53

The terminal now browses discovered CRDs and other live APIs with qualified
`resource.group/version` commands, unique aliases, typed server columns and
metadata fallback. `:columns` lists transient server keys; `:columns c2 c3`,
`default` and `none` select the layout without saving preferences. `:refresh`
renews discovery/watch on the current client. Enter/`d`, `y` and `e` open captured
details, redacted YAML and related events; generic actions remain read-only.

For your later installed preview, select an intentional context/resource:
`kuberich --context YOUR_CONTEXT --readonly --command 'resource widgets.example.test/v1beta1 YOUR_NAMESPACE'`.
This template is not a claim that those placeholder resources exist.

Exact tested local command:
`env COVERAGE_FILE=artifacts/custom-browser-53/final-corrections.coverage uv run pytest tests/unit/test_generic_commands.py tests/ui/test_app.py::test_unknown_and_empty_commands_do_not_echo_input_or_break_navigation tests/ui/test_navigation.py::test_narrow_completions_keep_selected_choice_visible_and_cursor_edits_hide_them tests/ui/test_custom_resources.py tests/contract/test_custom_projection.py tests/terminal/test_custom_resources.py -q --tb=short --cov=kuberich --cov-branch --cov-report=json:artifacts/custom-browser-53/final-corrections-coverage.json`:
35 cases passed in 72.19 seconds, including schema/version/scope/history,
malformed printer fallback, context/GVR/column races, reconnect, same-GVR
recreation/redaction, deferred startup feedback and explicit core read-only guards.
The date-order correction passed 167 cases in 67.02 seconds with
`env COVERAGE_FILE=artifacts/custom-browser-53/date-frozen.coverage uv run pytest tests/unit/test_custom_layout.py tests/unit/test_registry.py tests/contract/test_custom_projection.py tests/ui/test_custom_resources.py tests/terminal/test_custom_resources.py -q --tb=short --cov=kuberich --cov-branch --cov-report=json:artifacts/custom-browser-53/date-frozen-coverage.json`.
Equal timestamp/offset rows retain order after unrelated cached watch updates;
mixed timestamp/duration columns use documented groups. Earlier `98412c8` hosted
green checks are superseded by this demonstrated correction. Its replacement
passed the full required hosted gates.
The rebased unit/session/process/navigation/context cohort passed 2,150 cases.
The source native command
`uv run pytest tests/terminal/test_custom_resources.py -q --tb=short`
passed one case in 3.18 seconds with terminal restoration and redacted output.
The actual cluster command is
`uv run python -m scripts.verify_custom_resources_kind --kind artifacts/custom-browser-53/tools/kind --evidence artifacts/custom-browser-53/kind-recreated.json`:
all nine checks passed, including real generic UI/live/removal/recreation recovery, and the
owned disposable cluster was deleted. PR #170 merged as
`57af8ae6a5540a3fb9baf5b8cd4282d3914ef900`; #53 is completed. The corrected head
`a6cc4ad9704083142f554af7501f856d97d252b2` and actual tested PR merge checkout
`274037f0281996897bbbffde4594d8365ba6bd51` have the same tree as that merge.
[Application run 37959023794](https://github.com/carloshm91/kuberich/actions/runs/37959023794)
passed 3,919 cases in each of the four native jobs, with all 41 critical modules
at 100%, minimum 99.1551% production lines, 97.0660% branches and 97.61% changed
lines. All eight required checks succeeded. Independent artifact/provenance,
wheel/sdist payload, actual uv/pipx installs, source/installed PTYs, ten then-
required cluster rehearsals plus lifecycle/quickstart and both browser surfaces
were verified. See
[the guide](standard-resources.md#generic-discovered-resources-b06-53) and
[acceptance evidence](acceptance/generic-resource-browser.md).

## Development website publication checkpoint: #166

The maintainer authorized publishing the current landing and initial guides on
two Cloudflare Pages provider hosts before the product release. The main-only
manual `Website publication` workflow builds/browser-verifies both surfaces,
publishes the immutable checked artifact through the protected `release` job and
checks actual HTTPS file digests, headers and 404 routing. It retains source and
deployment receipts, including partial failures. The exact dispatch command is
`gh workflow run pages.yml --repo carloshm91/kuberich --ref main`.

Both provider hosts are now live:
[landing](https://kuberich-site.pages.dev) and
[initial documentation](https://kuberich-docs.pages.dev).
[Run 37947497284](https://github.com/carloshm91/kuberich/actions/runs/37947497284)
published source `0cfa7153bd8617c3ece3f5641d5b7e539b497ae4`, manifest SHA-256
`8661dbe055181e8aa73f18438c6d7724d1f1ed4a79f09d8527835e3d367035d7`.
The protected job verified every served file, header and 404 at production and
immutable deployment URLs; independent production verification matched the same
manifest. The first partial/failed run remains preserved in
[acceptance evidence](acceptance/pages-publication.md#actual-provider-acceptance).
Public packages, custom domains/DNS and `www` remain pending. Development notices
and noindex stay visible. See [the procedure](website.md#development-publication-166).

## Linux CI host checkpoint: #168

Repository, application, release and website Linux jobs now select Ubuntu 24.04.
Every Python/native, terminal/install, coverage and owned-cluster gate remains
selected. Release preflight rejects wrong requested host labels and stale job or
artifact names; the Ubuntu release pin does not freeze hosted system packages.

Exact tested command:
`uv run --locked --python 3.12 pytest tests/quality/test_ci_policy.py tests/quality/test_quality_gate.py tests/quality/test_release_policy.py tests/quality/test_release_transport.py tests/quality/test_site.py tests/quality/test_pages.py -q`:
290 passed on local Ubuntu 24.04/Python 3.12.12. Lint/format, strict application
and policy/site types, planning, build/metadata and both site checks passed;
`node scripts/verify_site_browser.mjs` checked all 49 pages at desktop/mobile
sizes with no accessibility violations. Application source and version are
unchanged by #168. PR #169 merged as
`f8d3673424214238b4a2722dc37d6bae4ccaf8eb` after all eight checks passed.
[The hosted application run](https://github.com/carloshm91/kuberich/actions/runs/37946446619)
passed 3,858 cases on each Linux 3.12/3.13/3.14 and macOS 3.12 job, with all 40
then-critical modules at 100%. Actual Linux job labels were `ubuntu-24.04`;
[the repository run](https://github.com/carloshm91/kuberich/actions/runs/37946446964)
had zero annotations and no Ubuntu-26 migration notice.
See [acceptance evidence](acceptance/ubuntu-runner-pin.md) and the live issue.

## Custom-resource backend checkpoint: C05 #52

Generic discovered LIST/WATCH/GET now retains bounded server Table columns and
full manifests, with ordinary-JSON fallback. Preferred versions and ambiguous
cross-group aliases come from discovery; refreshing installed/removed APIs keeps
the owned context client and namespace intent. This is backend delivery:
generic custom-resource terminal commands and presentation remain B06 #53.

Exact tested command:
`uv run --locked --python 3.12 pytest tests/unit/test_resources.py tests/unit/test_tables.py tests/unit/test_views.py tests/unit/test_watches.py tests/contract/test_resources.py tests/contract/test_watches.py tests/contract/test_workspace.py tests/contract/test_custom_resources.py tests/contract/test_custom_workspace.py -q --cov=kuberich --cov-branch`.
The expanded cohort passed 397 cases; each of the four involved critical domains
measured 100% lines/branches. The owned-cluster command is
`uv run --locked --python 3.12 python -m scripts.verify_custom_resources_kind --kind artifacts/operations-46/tools/kind`.
It verifies actual CRDs, Table events, version/removal refresh and RBAC. Its
receipt labels representation injections and confirms cluster deletion.
PR #165 merged after all eight required checks passed. Each Linux
3.12/3.13/3.14 and macOS 3.12 job passed 3,739 tests with all 40 then-critical
modules at 100% lines/branches. The local whole suite passed 3,739 tests in
2,523.05 seconds. See [acceptance evidence](acceptance/custom-resources.md) and
the [final measured receipt](https://github.com/carloshm91/kuberich/issues/52#issuecomment-6079451913).

## Attachment and file-transfer checkpoint: S07 #48

The selected container table now offers `a` for attach to an existing process,
`u` for upload and `d` for download. `:attach`, `:upload` and `:download` open that
table. Copy requires explicit absolute paths, a separate reviewed confirmation
and deliberate regular-file overwrite; Cancel is the default focus. Read-only
blocks attach/uploads and permits an explicit protected download.

Exact tested command:
`uv run --locked --python 3.12 pytest tests/unit/test_transfers.py tests/contract/test_transfer_files.py tests/contract/test_transfers.py tests/ui/test_transfers.py -q --cov=kuberich --cov-branch`:
The expanded cohort passed 178 cases, including UI refusal/race, malformed
PAX-size and concurrent destination replacement/cleanup cases. Source and fresh
installed-wheel native attach passed 14 cases; native copy passed four cases.
The owned-cluster command is
`uv run --locked --python 3.12 python -m scripts.verify_transfers_kind --kind artifacts/operations-46/tools/kind --kubectl artifacts/operations-46/tools/kubectl`.
Its 13 checks exercised real binary/tree round trips, existing init/ephemeral
containers, missing tar, interruptions and terminal return; the cluster was
deleted. Final-head hosted qualification passed all four required Linux
3.12/3.13/3.14 and macOS 3.12 jobs, each with 3,635 passing cases and all 39 then
critical modules at 100% lines/branches. Production lines were at least 99.19%,
branches at least 97.10%, and changed lines at least 98.59%. Linux 3.12 also
passed all ten then-required kind rehearsals and installed quickstart. PR #164
merged; [the final receipt](https://github.com/carloshm91/kuberich/issues/48#issuecomment-6078045340)
records the exact head, artifacts and limits.
See [the guide](container-attach-copy.md) and
[acceptance evidence](acceptance/container-transfers.md) for boundaries and results.
No user trial or package/site publication is required between product tickets.

## Flat website and reference checkpoint: #162

The local landing and initial docs share a light flat design, real UI captures,
keyboard navigation and a compact mobile guide menu. Nineteen authored guides
and three source-generated references build for both proposed hosts. CLI flags,
resource aliases/columns and capability status come from maintained declarations;
behavioral guides still need updates with each implementation PR.

Exact tested commands: `uv run python -m scripts.build_site`,
`uv run python -m scripts.check_site`,
`uv run pytest tests/quality/test_site.py -q`, and
`node scripts/verify_site_browser.mjs` after the documented locked QA install.
See [acceptance evidence](acceptance/flat-website.md) and
[local preview instructions](../website/README.md). At that preparation checkpoint,
the source was `0.0.1.dev0` and public packages, website hosting and DNS were not
activated. #166 subsequently delivered provider preview hosting; #89 retains
final-candidate qualification and separately approved product/domain publication.

## Credential interoperability checkpoint: C08 #47

Generic `:login` now honors Never/IfAvailable/Always; token files refresh, and exec
certificate renewal replaces TLS connections and removes old private material.
Captured HTTP(S)/SOCKS5 proxies retain TLS names and selected helper identity.
See [the supported contracts and migration paths](kubeconfig-interoperability.md).

The exact focused command is
`uv run --locked --python 3.12 pytest --tb=short -q tests/contract/test_proxy_transport.py tests/contract/test_generic_credentials.py tests/contract/test_workspace.py`:
72 passed. Native generic/Azure login and handoff checks passed 24 cases; the final
source/fresh-wheel credential and encrypted-key checks passed another 11 cases.
The actual Kubernetes command is
`uv run --locked --python 3.12 python -m scripts.verify_credential_interop_kind --kind artifacts/operations-46/tools/kind --kubectl artifacts/operations-46/tools/kubectl`:
all 27 checks passed, including real TLS/proxy browsing, logs, exec, forwarding and
owned cleanup. Full final-head coverage, installed-wheel and hosted qualification
are merge requirements; [acceptance evidence](acceptance/credential-interoperability.md)
and the live issue/PR retain the candidate results. Real cloud certification
remains Q05 #87; actual Helm remains #66. No package/site/tag publication occurs.

## Historical first product release policy checkpoint: #154

At this historical #154 checkpoint, the first-public policy was **1.0.0**;
the phased #89 preparation above supersedes it. Intermediate 0.x milestones were
engineering checkpoints; product features continue before dedicated final
platform/performance/install qualification. All their actual prerequisites and
quality evidence remain required before #89. The installed development version
is still `0.0.1.dev0`; this checkpoint adds no tag or package/site publication.

The exact tested command is
`uv run --locked --python 3.12 pytest -q tests/quality/test_release_policy.py tests/quality/test_release_transport.py tests/quality/test_homebrew.py`:
145 passed, including real HTTP/Git witnesses for rejected 0.x publication and
transitive readiness. `python scripts/validate_plan.py` checks the execution map
against tooling policy. See [acceptance evidence](acceptance/first-product-release-policy.md)
and the live issue/PR for final native/platform/package results.
This policy originally prepared initial hosting for #89. The later explicit
#166 authorization delivered Pages provider previews before product qualification;
final product/domain launch remains #89 and expanded docs remain #90/#91.

## Resource operations checkpoint: M04 #46

[Resource operations](resource-operations.md) add selected deletion through
`:delete`, explicit selection/review through `:deletebatch`, and `:trigger`,
`:suspend` and `:resume` on supported Jobs/CronJobs. Review captures identity,
version, scope and options; Cancel is the default and Confirm is separate.
Batch results remain independent, finalizers remain intact, and ambiguous
transport outcomes require inspection before another write.

After the native-terminal prerequisite, the rebased checkout passed 186 focused
operation/mutation/terminal cases. The actual tested cluster command is
`uv run --locked --python 3.12 python -m scripts.verify_operations_kind --kind artifacts/operations-46/tools/kind --evidence artifacts/operations-46/rebased-kind.json`.
All 13 real API checks passed and the owned cluster was removed. The binary is
the pinned local kind 0.33.0; do not substitute an active cloud context.
See [acceptance evidence](acceptance/resource-operations.md) and #46's linked PR
for final candidate coverage, installed-wheel and hosted Linux/macOS results.
At that checkpoint, the first-public policy was 1.0.0; current phased policy is above.

## Public hosted verification checkpoint: #157

The public source repository can execute standard Linux/macOS Actions again.
Required macOS execution exposed terminal-observer/driver assumptions; #157
repairs the observer and preserves hangup status when Darwin still returns TTY
attributes but rejects output. No platform tests are skipped.
The exact focused verification command is
`uv run --locked --python 3.12 pytest -q tests/terminal/test_observer.py tests/unit/test_terminal_lease.py tests/contract/test_mutation_faults.py`.
`uv run --locked --python 3.12 pytest -q tests/ui/test_mutations.py` also verifies
visible feedback after deliberately delayed result delivery, including compact
terminal confirmation and redacted history.
See [acceptance evidence](acceptance/macos-terminal-verification.md) and the linked
issue/PR for delivered-head hosted results. #157 and #46 are now merged after
their required hosted checks passed. That checkpoint's first-public policy was
1.0.0; current phased policy is above. Source opening did not publish package or website artifacts.

## Apache-2.0 and public source checkpoint: #155

The maintainer approved opening `carloshm91/kuberich` under Apache-2.0 on
2026-10-08. LICENSE and NOTICE retain Carlos Herrera/contributor attribution;
wheels/source distributions carry both, and Homebrew declares the same license.
Use the checkout with `uv sync --locked --group dev`, then
`uv run kuberich --version` and `uv run kuberich --help`. See
[licensing](licensing.md) for the actual derivative/commercial permissions and
[acceptance evidence](acceptance/apache-public-source.md) for measured checks.
No package release, public tap, website deployment or DNS change accompanies
this source-opening checkpoint. At that checkpoint, the first-public policy was 1.0.0; current phased policy is above.
Earlier private checkpoint descriptions below retain their historical context.

## Initial private website checkpoint: #150

The initial landing and sixteen user guides now build locally from the maintained
repository documentation. Both the landing with `/docs/` and a separate root docs
host are prepared. The actual tested command is `uv run python -m scripts.build_site`;
`uv run python -m scripts.check_site` validates the generated output.
Local preview is `uv run python -m http.server 8715 --bind 127.0.0.1 --directory artifacts/site/www`.
Read [site instructions](website.md) and [acceptance evidence](acceptance/initial-website.md)
for measured checks and pending candidate/publication limits. Nothing has been
published; DNS and private repository visibility are unchanged. Continuous private
work does not require an intermediate maintainer trial.

## KubeRich identity checkpoint: #149

The maintainer chose **KubeRich** and confirmed purchasing `kuberich.com`.
Canonical checkout commands are:

```sh
uv sync --locked --group dev
uv run kuberich --version
uv run kuberich --help
uv run kuberich
```

The `kubetrol` console alias still launches the same application. Existing
preferences are read in place, and `kuberich config migrate` explicitly creates
the new file while retaining the original. See [configuration compatibility](configuration.md).
The repository is now `carloshm91/kuberich` and remains private; its old URLs and
SSH address redirect to the preserved repository. [Acceptance evidence](acceptance/identity-migration.md)
records 2,977 passing cases on each Linux Python 3.12/3.13/3.14 interpreter,
above 99% lines and 97% branches, and 100% critical/changed-line coverage.
Actual source/installed terminals, uv/pipx alias install/uninstall and all eight
owned Kubernetes rehearsals passed. Native macOS/full hosted release qualification
remain pending. The exact installed rehearsal command was
`uv run python -m scripts.verify_quickstart --wheel /tmp/kuberich-149-evidence/frozen-dist/kuberich-0.0.1.dev0-py3-none-any.whl --kind /tmp/kubetrol-tools/kind --kubectl /tmp/kubetrol-tools/shell/bin/kubectl --evidence /tmp/kuberich-149-evidence/kind-quickstart.json`.
The temporary binaries and wheel in that earlier command were removed by an
environment restart after qualification. Regenerated packages/audits are retained
locally under `artifacts/identity-149`; the acceptance report records this limit.
Continuous private delivery does not require an intermediate maintainer trial.
Public installation, website/DNS and visibility changes remain separately
authorized launch steps.

Earlier checkpoints below preserve original tested commands and artifact names.

## Workload operations checkpoint: M03 #45

[Selected workload operations](workloads.md) add `:scale`, `:restart` and explicit
`:rollback` with Review/default Cancel/separate Confirm. `:rollout` reads actual
progress and works in read-only mode; Cancel does not claim a server undo.
The automated command is
`uv run python -m scripts.verify_workloads_kind --kind /tmp/kubetrol-tools/kind --evidence /tmp/kubetrol-45-evidence/kind.json`.
Actual Deployment and StatefulSet/DaemonSet rollback, narrow RBAC, HPA and failure/
cancellation checks passed on an owned cluster, which was deleted.
[Acceptance evidence](acceptance/workloads.md) records 2,952 passing cases on each
Linux Python 3.12/3.13/3.14 interpreter, over 99% production lines and 97%
branches, and all 34 critical modules at 100%. Native source/fresh-wheel terminals,
builds and locked/fresh dependency audits also passed; native macOS and the full
hosted release matrix remain outstanding.
Private work proceeds without intermediate maintainer trials;
public installation/release remains separately gated.

## Manifest edit checkpoint: M02 #44

The preview adds [selected manifest editing](editing.md) through `:edit` / Shift+E:
explicit local disclosure, native editor, redacted diff, strict server dry-run
and separate guarded Apply. Cancel has default focus; `--readonly` blocks edits.
The automated command is `uv run python -m scripts.verify_editing_kind --kind /tmp/kubetrol-tools/kind --evidence /tmp/kubetrol-44-evidence/kind.json`.
All 12 real API checks passed on an owned disposable Kubernetes cluster, which
was deleted. [Acceptance evidence](acceptance/editing.md) records 2,836 tests
passing on each Linux Python 3.12/3.13/3.14 interpreter, independent coverage gates
above 99% lines and 97% branches, and all 33 critical modules at 100%. Actual
foreground-editor and fresh-wheel terminal trials also passed. Native macOS and
full hosted release qualification remain outstanding.
Secret manifest disclosure, scale/rollout and deletion retain their separate
tasks. Continuous private work does not require an intermediate maintainer trial.

## Guarded write checkpoint: M01 #43

The preview adds [explicit annotation changes](mutations.md): `:annotate` prepares
an identified change, Review shows context/namespace/name/UID/version/effect, and
deliberate Confirm sends one guarded patch. `:writes` retains public outcomes;
`--readonly` blocks modifications. Editing, scaling and deletion remain separate
tasks. The automated command is `uv run python -m scripts.verify_mutations_kind --kind /tmp/kubetrol-tools/kind --evidence /tmp/kubetrol-43-evidence/kind-final.json`.
Actual writes, stale UID/version refusal and real RBAC denial passed on an owned
disposable cluster, which was deleted. See [acceptance evidence](acceptance/mutations.md)
for final qualification status: 2,730 tests passed on each Linux Python
3.12/3.13/3.14 interpreter, independent coverage gates passed, and all 32 critical
modules reached 100%. Native source/fresh-wheel terminal and actual Kubernetes
behavior passed; full macOS/hosted release qualification remains pending. Continuous private delivery does not require a
manual maintainer trial at this checkpoint.

## Port-forward checkpoint: S05 #42

The preview adds [managed pod/Service TCP forwarding](port-forwards.md): Shift+F
on a selected pod/Service opens mappings; `:pf` lists and `s` stops selected.
Forwards survive namespace changes and stop on context/retry/exit. The automated
owned-cluster command is `uv run python -m scripts.verify_port_forwards_kind --kind /tmp/kubetrol-tools/kind --kubectl /tmp/kubetrol-tools/shell/bin/kubectl --evidence /tmp/kubetrol-42-evidence/kind.json`.
Actual Pod/Service HTTP and cleanup passed on a newly owned disposable cluster;
see [acceptance evidence](acceptance/port-forwards.md). Source/package publication
and full hosted/macOS release qualification remain separate gates. Continuous
private implementation proceeds without requiring intermediate manual trials.

## Standard resource checkpoint: B05 #41

The preview adds 15 [standard resource tables](standard-resources.md). An initial
scoped launch is `uv run kubetrol --context YOUR_CONTEXT --readonly --command 'deploy YOUR_NAMESPACE'`.
Use `:deploy`, `:svc`, `:job`, `:cm`, `:sec`, `:no`, `:pvc`, `:pv` or `:sc`;
Enter opens details and `y` opens redacted YAML. This checkpoint's automated
owned-cluster command is
`uv run python -m scripts.verify_contexts_kind --kind /tmp/kubetrol-tools/kind --evidence /tmp/kubetrol-41-evidence/kind-frozen.json`.
It passed with real LIST/WATCH/GET for every advertised family and removed its
disposable cluster. See [acceptance evidence](acceptance/standard-resources.md).
Scaling/editing and publication remain separate tasks. No intermediate manual
trial is required; continuous private implementation proceeds after verification.

## Private CI checkpoint: #109

The installed preview and launch command below are unchanged. Private development
uses all Linux Python minors plus one macOS baseline per PR; full six-environment
qualification is mandatory before release. Actual hosted after-change timing
remains pending while Actions cannot start. See [the usage audit](acceptance/private-ci.md).

## Current installation and trial guide: W01 #39

Use the [current quickstart](quickstart.md) for one ordered trial of the installed
preview. Checkout launch example:
`uv run kubetrol --context YOUR_CONTEXT --namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE --readonly`.
For a deliberately selected test scope, `--write` enables embedded shells even
when the preferences are read-only. Public 0.0.1/PyPI/Homebrew publication remains
pending #40; the source checkout reports `0.0.1.dev0`. Earlier sections below
preserve historical checkpoints.
The installed Linux candidate rehearsal passed with this exact command:
`uv run python -m scripts.verify_quickstart --wheel /tmp/kubetrol-39-evidence/target-3.13/canonical-rc0/release-candidate/dist/kubetrol-0.0.1rc1-py3-none-any.whl --kind /tmp/kubetrol-tools/kind --kubectl /tmp/kubetrol-tools/shell/bin/kubectl --evidence /tmp/kubetrol-39-evidence/quickstart-frozen-rc.json`.
It exercised read-only navigation/logs and a write-enabled embedded shell outside
the checkout, then removed its own installation and disposable cluster.
See [measured W01 evidence](acceptance/quickstart.md) for scope and limitations.

The installable CLI, local preferences and first terminal window are available
from the development checkout, including the live pod table, container logs and embedded shells. Use the latest
resource-workspace trial below; earlier sections record previous checkpoints and may name
short-lived branches that have since been deleted.
Current delivery continues without waiting for intermediate manual trials. The
maintainer will test the installed product and provide feedback later.

## Disposable-cluster checkpoint: Q01 #38

The preview remains usable. Integration scripts verify their generated API
endpoint against the actual owned Docker node before fixture writes and clean up
on graceful cancellation, failure and success. Tested command:
`uv run python -m scripts.verify_kind_lifecycle --kind /tmp/kubetrol-tools/kind --evidence /tmp/kubetrol-38-evidence/kind-lifecycle.json`.
It proves real setup cancellation, ready cancellation and injected body failure.
See [integration qualification](integration-testing.md) for tools and commands.
No additional resource view is claimed.


## Homebrew preparation checkpoint: D03 #37

The app UI and development version are unchanged. A canonical local RC now
produces a verified source formula and tap scaffold. Actual installation is
qualified in an owned Linux container; public tap creation and macOS/online checks
remain D04. The tested local check is
`uv run pytest -q tests/quality/test_homebrew.py tests/quality/test_release_transport.py`.
See [Homebrew delivery](homebrew.md) for candidate commands and limits. No new
intermediate manual trial is required.

## Release pipeline checkpoint: D02 #36

The installed pod/log/embedded-shell UI is unchanged. Release preparation now
verifies an exact candidate bundle, source identity and original artifact bytes;
publication is a separately reviewed workflow and is not available under the
current private/billing/protection restrictions. The exact local test command is
`uv run --locked --python 3.12 pytest tests/quality/test_release_policy.py tests/quality/test_release_transport.py tests/packaging/test_release_candidate.py`.
See [release pipeline](release-pipeline.md) for local-only candidate commands,
owner setup, complete matrix requirements and recovery. No tag/package is published.

## Dependency security checkpoint: Q04 #35

The terminal behavior remains the installed pod/log/shell preview below. Q04 adds
automated installed-runtime audits, original license notices and artifact-linked
SBOM evidence; it adds no new resource action. Its exact local preview command is
`uv run --locked --python 3.12 pytest tests/quality/test_supply_chain_policy.py tests/contract/test_hostile_boundaries.py tests/packaging/test_supply_chain.py`.
See [dependency security](dependency-security.md) for the full build/verify flow.
There is still no published package or release; hosted/macOS qualification remains
the public-release gate.

## Installed artifact qualification: D01 #34

The development launch remains `uv run kubetrol`. Local wheel/source builds now
exclude tests, development scripts, caches and undeclared private files while
retaining the complete application, styles, metadata and license.
Required packaging checks install both formats with real isolated `uv tool`
and pip-backed `pipx`, then exercise their exposed CLI and terminal outside the
checkout. They own and remove their tool installations.

The tested qualification command is:

```sh
uv run --locked --python 3.12 pytest tests/packaging
```

See [distribution](distribution.md) and [D01 acceptance](acceptance/distribution-artifacts.md)
for measured status. Public PyPI/Homebrew installation and version `0.0.1`
remain the separate release gate; no intermediate manual trial is required.

## Terminal reliability: Q02 #33

The same development command remains `uv run kubetrol`. The default shell stays
inside the interface. This checkpoint adds actual SSH/tmux checks and repairs
external shutdown, malformed shell sequences and text retention on resize.
SSH loss closes the application and its child outside tmux; a tmux session can
be reattached with the same embedded shell still running. Cancelling a shell
before its pod preflight completes returns to containers without launching it.

The tested terminal command and prerequisites are in
[terminal compatibility](terminal-compatibility.md), with final qualification in
[Q02 acceptance](acceptance/terminal-qualification.md). No intermediate manual
trial is required; macOS and physical clipboard certification remain explicit
public-release/environment checks.

## Azure helper contracts and explicit login: C07 #22

The workspace now has `:login` for the declared Azure kubelogin helper. Existing
sessions remain usable through normal `uv run kubetrol`; device/browser login can
use the native terminal explicitly, restore the UI and reconnect. Read-only mode
permits authentication while still blocking cluster actions. Tokens are captured
privately; native prompts use stderr, and stdin follows Never/IfAvailable/Always.

The tested local check is:

```sh
uv run pytest tests/contract/test_azure_credentials.py tests/contract/test_aks_verifier.py tests/ui/test_azure_sessions.py tests/terminal/test_azure_login.py tests/unit/test_credential_helpers.py
```

These tests use synthetic providers and owned APIs/PTYS. Actual AKS/Entra trials
remain deferred to Q05 #87; no intermediate manual trial is required to continue.
See [AKS behavior](aks-authentication.md) and [acceptance](acceptance/aks-authentication.md).

## EKS helper contracts: C06 #21

The EKS work preserves the existing workspace, logs and embedded shell trial below.
Local contracts now distinguish recognized AWS login/role errors and serialize
expiring-token refreshes. Delayed concurrent 401s cannot discard newer cache
revisions, and delegated shells retain the selected session's AWS environment.

The exact local contract check is:

```sh
uv run pytest tests/contract/test_eks_credentials.py tests/contract/test_eks_verifier.py tests/ui/test_eks_sessions.py tests/unit/test_credential_helpers.py
```

These are synthetic/loopback tests. The maintainer deferred their real-cluster
trial until the installed preview; actual EKS certification remains pending Q05 #87.
The optional real read-only command and its limits are in
[EKS authentication](eks-authentication.md).

## Responsive header logo: #132

From the latest main checkout in an interactive terminal:

```sh
git pull --ff-only
uv sync --locked --group dev
KUBETROL_THEME=k9s uv run kubetrol
```

At 120+ columns and 16+ rows, the upper-right header displays the original
five-row `ktrol` ASCII logo. At 70–119 columns it uses a small `ktrol` wordmark
to preserve shortcut space; narrower/shorter terminals hide it. Resize, then
visit `:ctx`, `:ns`, pods, containers and logs: header geometry stays consistent
at the same terminal size. `--logoless` and `--headless` still hide the logo.
The project, package and command remain `kubetrol`, with version `0.0.1.dev0`.

The navigation trial below remains applicable. Tab/click focus feedback is
tracked separately in #61; this branding change does not resolve it.
See [actual renders and measured qualification](acceptance/header-logo.md).

## Bordered commands, context table and container details: #129

From the latest main checkout in an interactive terminal:

```sh
git pull --ff-only
uv sync --locked --group dev
KUBETROL_THEME=k9s uv run kubetrol
```

The environment override selects the reference theme even if existing
preferences name another theme; it changes no file. Add `--context YOUR_CONTEXT`
if needed.

1. Check context/cluster/user aliases and installed `0.0.1.dev0` above the table.
   Press `:` and type `c`: `context` appears as a suggested suffix on that
   same bar, without a dropdown. Down cycles candidates; Tab accepts one.
   The command bar has a rectangular border. At heights under 16 rows it keeps
   side borders to leave usable table space. Press Escape, then `/` to try the
   separate filter row; focus does not move the outer frame.
2. Enter `:ctx` (or press `c`) for the normal context table. `/` filters names,
   cluster/auth-info aliases and default namespaces locally. Escape first clears
   the filter, then returns to the preceding resource view. Enter connects to
   the highlighted context and opens pods. Browsing does not change kubeconfig.
   From a filtered context table, `:ns YOUR_NAMESPACE` opens pods with a clear
   query; pressing `c` afterward restores the local context filter.
3. Enter `:ns` for the live namespace table. Filter with `/`, select with arrows
   or `j/k`, then Enter for pods. Escape first clears a filter, then follows
   the bottom route back to namespaces. `0` opens all namespaces.
4. Enter a pod to inspect its container image, ready/state/restarts, probes,
   requests/limits and ports; scroll horizontally with arrows if needed.
   These values are from the captured pod snapshot; reopen to refresh them.
   Missing status shows `—`/Unknown. CPU/MEM columns show configured requests/
   limits, not live consumption. Enter a container for logs. Check that the outer frame and header columns stay in place while the
   available shortcuts change. Click Pause and the search input; resize and return
   to the original size. Escape follows the bottom route.
5. In containers, `s` opens the existing embedded shell. `exit` or Ctrl+] returns
   to that container; Ctrl+C interrupts the remote program and Ctrl+Q quits.

Update notices, cluster metrics and custom/live themes remain planned.
See [workspace behavior](resource-workspace.md) and
[qualification evidence](acceptance/context-container-workspace.md).

| Checkpoint | Required work | What can actually be tried |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Installed CLI | F01, then F02 quality gates | Run help/version from an installed development wheel |
| Local preferences and diagnostics | F03 | Run `info`/`config check`, create defaults and inspect sanitized local logs |
| First terminal window | F01 → F02 → F03 → B01 | Launch the Textual shell, navigate, open help, resize and quit; show an honest unconnected state |
| Launch contract | F05 | Help/version, visibility flags, policy, effective refresh and connection overrides; later features fail explicitly |
| Context session | C01 | Connect, select contexts/namespaces, retry and observe distinct connection errors |
| Resource read backend | C02 | Verify real discovery and paginated snapshots on an owned disposable cluster; the UI table is still empty |
| Resource synchronization backend | C03 | Verify live UID state, reconnect and cancellation; UI subscription/table integration follows |
| First live cluster view | F04/F05, C01-C04, B02/B03/B04 | Choose context/namespace, inspect live pods, filter and open details/events |
| Logs and interactive shell | S01-S04, credential/PTY/integration checks | Follow current/previous logs, choose a container, enter its shell and return safely |
| Planned public 0.1.0 | D06/full prerequisites, #53/#54/#123 and common launch gates, then #89 activation | Install through actually qualified public channels and follow the candidate-tested guide |

The implementation order deliberately puts B01 immediately after configuration
and quality foundations. At each checkpoint, the implementing PR must provide the
exact tested development-install/run command and state which capabilities exist.
Avoid publishing guessed installation commands before the package exists.

For the CLI checkpoint, run `uv sync --locked --group dev`, then
`uv run kubetrol --help` and `uv run kubetrol --version` from the checkout.
No cluster or kubeconfig is required. See the README for details.

For the F03 checkpoint, run `uv run kubetrol info` and
`uv run kubetrol config check`. Neither writes files. To test initialization
without touching your default preferences, choose a temporary directory:

```sh
trial_dir=$(mktemp -d)
uv run kubetrol --config "$trial_dir/preferences.yaml" config init
uv run kubetrol --config "$trial_dir/preferences.yaml" config check
uv run kubetrol --config "$trial_dir/preferences.yaml" info
```

The second `config init` at the same path must refuse to overwrite and exit 3.
`info` now reports `terminal_ui_available: true` and `cluster_connected: false`.
See [preferences](configuration.md) for optional debug-log testing.

## First terminal window: B01

From an interactive terminal in the checkout:

```sh
uv sync --locked --group dev
KUBECONFIG=/nonexistent/kubetrol-preview uv run kubetrol
```

1. Confirm you see Kubetrol, `Context: —`, `Namespace: —` and `Disconnected`.
   The resource table has headers and no rows because no cluster is connected.
2. Press `?` to open help, then `Esc` to return.
3. Press `/`, type a few letters, then `Enter` to return to the table. `Esc`
   clears the active filter. The input works; there are no resources to filter yet.
4. Press `:`, type `help`, then `Enter`. Close the help with `Esc` or its Back button.
5. Resize the window. Context, namespace, connection state and controls stay
   accessible down to the tested size of 40 columns by 12 rows. In narrow windows,
   use left/right arrows in the table to see columns outside the viewport.
6. Press `q` while the table has focus, or Ctrl+Q anywhere, to return to your shell.

Feedback: report whether it opens, whether help/filter/quit work, and your
terminal name and size if anything overlaps or is difficult to read.
The [control reference](terminal-preview.md) covers focus, themes and errors.
Context selection is available in C01 below; pods, logs and exec remain upcoming.

## Launch options: F05 stage 1

```sh
uv sync --locked --group dev
uv run kubetrol version --short
uv run kubetrol --readonly --headless --command help
```

Close help with Esc. Confirm the header is hidden and `Read-only` appears at the
start of the status. Type `:shell` and Enter: the status must say read-only blocks
it. Press `q` from the table to return to your shell. You can separately try
`uv run kubetrol --logoless` or `uv run kubetrol --crumbsless` and compare the header
and scope bar with the default launch.

`--context`, kubeconfig, namespace and timeout selection are now implemented by
C01; see the next checkpoint. F05 #19 now adds effective connection overrides
and periodic table refresh. See the [full launch contract](k9s-cli.md).

### F05 connection checkpoint

The following launch form was exercised with owned fake APIs, actual source and
installed CLI terminals, and a disposable kind cluster. Replace the example
aliases/files/namespace with your own explicit selection:

```sh
uv sync --locked --group dev
KUBETROL_THEME=k9s uv run kubetrol --context YOUR_CONTEXT --refresh 2
```

For the first feedback pass, open `:ctx`, return with Escape, open `:ns`, select
a namespace, then open a pod and its container logs. The selection/filter should
remain stable as table ages update. Connection overrides are optional; when
needed, cluster/user aliases, certificate paths and impersonation are documented
in the [connection contract](k9s-cli.md#effective-invocation-connection).
Cloud provider qualification and later resource/action views remain separate.

Cloud authentication and real-terminal checks run early. A successful mocked UI
is useful feedback, but it does not certify that EKS/AKS credentials, exec,
reconnects or clean-machine installation work. Provider contract tests and actual
cloud smoke results are recorded separately.

The maintainer is notified when each checkpoint is ready. Feature milestones are
scope gates, not promised dates. Bugs discovered during these trials become
focused issues; release numbers change through the documented release workflow.

## Context sessions: C01

From your interactive terminal, using a kubeconfig you already trust:

```sh
uv sync --locked --group dev
uv run kubetrol
```

1. Check the context, namespace and connection state. Resource rows remain empty:
   this checkpoint discovers namespaces; the pod browser comes next.
2. Press `c` (or F2), choose a context with arrows and Enter. Check its state updates.
3. Press `n` (or F3), choose a namespace and Enter. For restricted namespace-list RBAC,
   type `:ns YOUR_NAMESPACE` and Enter instead.
4. Press `i` or type `:status` and Enter to read the complete connection message.
5. Press `r` or type `:retry` and Enter to reconnect; Ctrl+Q returns to your shell.

Letter shortcuts work outside the text fields; Escape returns to the table.
If your terminal intercepts F2/F3, type `:ctx` or `:ns` and Enter instead.
The context-preview correction (#102) accepts null optional exec lists, including
`env: null` in doctl-generated configuration. Restart from the corrected branch
before trying the context again; no kubeconfig edits are needed.

Optionally launch with `uv run kubetrol --context YOUR_CONTEXT -n YOUR_NAMESPACE`.
Nothing changes your kubeconfig or its current context. Report the connection
state/message and whether the selectors and quit work; never paste credentials
or kubeconfig contents. Provider-specific qualification is still pending.
See [supported authentication and limits](context-sessions.md).

## Resource reads: C02 backend checkpoint

The backend now discovers resource types and reads consistent paginated snapshots.
There is no new terminal interaction to try in this PR: `:ns NAME` selects a scope
and the table still has no pod rows. C03 (updates), C04 (store) and B02 (table)
complete the first visible pod view. Command/argument suggestions with Tab are
accepted work in B03 #27, not implemented completion in this checkpoint.

To verify this backend without using a real cluster, run:

```sh
uv sync --locked --group dev
uv run pytest tests/unit/test_resources.py tests/contract/test_resources.py
```

The tests own their loopback servers and synthetic credentials. For the actual
Kubernetes qualification command and retained evidence, see
[resource discovery](resource-discovery.md).

## Resource updates: C03 backend checkpoint

The backend now keeps resource snapshots updated through a recoverable watch.
The terminal still shows the context/namespace checkpoint with no pod rows;
C04 #25 integrates context/scope ownership and B02 #26 provides the visible table.

For this block's isolated behavioral trial:

```sh
uv sync --locked --group dev
uv run pytest tests/unit/test_watches.py tests/contract/test_watches.py
```

These tests cover real loopback HTTP streams, opaque versions, duplicate events,
UID recreation, expired versions, permissions, retries and cleanup. The required
kind check also exercises actual resource changes in an owned disposable cluster.
See [synchronization behavior and limits](resource-watches.md).

## Active view ownership: C04

From an interactive terminal in the development checkout:

```sh
uv sync --locked --group dev
uv run kubetrol
```

1. Choose a context with `:ctx` or `c`. Look for `Live` and the pod count.
   **The table still has no rows**; B02 #26 supplies them next.
2. Type `:ns YOUR_NAMESPACE` and Enter. Check the namespace and count update;
   the old snapshot is cleared while the new scope loads. `:ns *` selects all.
3. Press `i` or enter `:status` for the full message. Lost connectivity or denied
   reads must show stale/error state, rather than a successful empty list.
4. Close details with Esc, try another context or `:retry`, then Ctrl+Q to quit.

Report whether the context/namespace and count match `kubectl` for that scope,
and the safe status message for a failure. No credentials or kubeconfig contents
are needed. These commands are qualified with owned fake APIs, real PTYs and a
disposable kind cluster; actual cloud-provider qualification remains pending.
See [active-view behavior](resource-views.md) for isolated tests and limits.

## Quiet-watch correction: #107

From this correction's branch, in your interactive terminal:

```sh
git fetch origin
git switch fix/107-watch-preview
uv sync --locked --group dev
uv run kubetrol
```

Choose a context with `:ctx`, then type `:ns YOUR_NAMESPACE` and Enter. Look for
**Resource data ready** and **Live · N pods**. Leave it open for 30 seconds:
ordinary watch renewal should keep Live without periodic reconnect warnings.
The table still has no rows; B02 #26 adds them next. `:ctx` is a shortcut hint,
not an automatic context change. A real failed stream still shows stale/error
state; press `i` to read the full safe message. Ctrl+Q returns to your shell.

For feedback, report the namespace/count and, if a retry still appears, only its
safe status text. These steps use your chosen trusted local configuration; the
automated evidence uses owned fake APIs and a uniquely created/deleted kind cluster.


## Live pod table: B02 #26 — current trial

Run from your checkout in an interactive terminal:

```sh
git switch main
git pull --ff-only
uv sync --locked --group dev
uv run kubetrol
```

1. Enter `:ctx`, choose your context and press Enter.
2. Enter `:ns YOUR_NAMESPACE` and Enter. You should now see actual pod rows with
   READY, STATUS, RESTARTS and AGE. Compare with `kubectl get pods -n YOUR_NAMESPACE`
   using that same context. A successful empty scope says **No pods in this scope**.
3. Use arrows/PageDown; `s` cycles sorting and Shift+S reverses it. Left/right and
   Home/End scroll columns. Click a header if you prefer the mouse.
4. Leave it open for 30 seconds. Existing rows/selection should remain stable and
   ages update. A genuine outage keeps rows with a stale warning.
5. Try `:ns *` for all namespaces, then Ctrl+Q to return to your shell.

Report whether rows/count match the chosen scope, which state looks wrong if any,
and whether navigation feels comfortable. Details/logs/exec have their own tickets.
See [pod semantics](pod-table.md).
No public package/release has been published.

## Commands and filters: B03 #27 — current trial

```sh
git switch main
git pull --ff-only
uv sync --locked --group dev
uv run kubetrol
```

1. Type `:ctx ` followed by the first letters of your context. Check the visible
   suggestions, select with Up/Down, press Tab and then Enter.
2. Type `:ns ` and part of your namespace; Tab and Enter should open its pods.
   If namespace listing is denied, type the complete permitted name instead.
3. Press `/`, type part of a pod name and Enter. Check **visible/total pods**.
   Escape in the table clears it. Try `/re:api|worker` for regex matching.
4. Change namespace with `:ns NAME`, then `:back` and `:forward`. Scope, filter,
   sorting and surviving pod selection should return. Alt+Left/Right also work.
5. Type `:help` for the current commands; Ctrl+Q returns to your shell.

Report whether Tab chooses the expected literal name, counts/filter results match,
and history returns to the intended view. These commands only read your chosen
cluster; credential helpers retain the established local trust model. Test evidence
uses owned APIs and a disposable kind cluster. See [navigation behavior and
limits](command-navigation.md); no public package or release has been published.

## Resource inspection: B04

From an interactive terminal on updated `main`:

```sh
uv sync --locked --group dev
uv run kubetrol
```

1. Use `:ctx` and `:ns` to choose your context and namespace; select a pod row.
2. Press `y` for YAML, `d` for details, and `e` for related events.
3. Press `m` to show/hide managedFields. Press `/`, type `containers` and Enter;
   `n`/`N` move through matches.
4. Use arrows and PageUp/PageDown to scroll; Ctrl+Y copies redacted text if the
   terminal permits clipboard writes.
5. Escape leaves the search input, then returns to the table with its selection,
   sorting, filter and viewport retained.

Report whether the selected pod opens, whether events show data or a clear
permission error, and whether search/return work in your terminal. Reopen to
refresh inspection data. Logs and shell remain upcoming. See the
[viewer contract](resource-inspection.md) and [B04 evidence](acceptance/B04.md).

## Log transport: S01

The selected-container transport now has API/encoding/cancellation tests and an
owned-cluster trial. This backend checkpoint adds no terminal log action yet;
S02 supplies the viewer and controls. Continue testing the live table and B04
inspection above. Developers can run:

```sh
uv run pytest tests/unit/test_logs.py tests/contract/test_logs.py
```

See [log semantics and limits](container-log-transport.md).

## Container logs: S02 — current trial

From an interactive terminal on updated `main`:

```sh
git switch main
git pull --ff-only
uv sync --locked --group dev
uv run kubetrol
```

1. Choose your context/namespace with `:ctx` and `:ns`. Select a pod and press
   Enter to see its containers, then Enter on a container to read its logs.
   Check that the title names it. `l` remains the direct log shortcut.
2. Press `g` to read the oldest retained output, then `G` (Shift+G) to follow
   the newest. `j/k`, arrows and page keys scroll; upward movement leaves follow.
3. Press `/`, type visible text and Enter; `n/N` move through matching lines.
4. Press `p` to pause reception. Try `g`, `G` and `f`: navigation still works,
   and following does not unpause. Press `p` again to resume reception.
5. Try `w` for wrapping, `t` for timestamps and `?` for all controls.
   Escape leaves an input, then returns logs → containers → pods; Ctrl+Q quits.

Compare against `kubectl logs` for the same explicit context, namespace,
container and time window. Report any safe error text and whether scrolling,
search, resize and return work. Retention is bounded to 5,000 lines and 4 MiB;
the dropped counter explains missing older history. Previous output may be
unavailable before a container restart. Read-only mode supports this viewer.
See [log behavior and limits](log-viewer.md) and [S02 evidence](acceptance/S02.md).
Interactive shell remains the next product checkpoint; no public release exists.

## Enter navigation: feedback #115 — current trial

From an interactive terminal on updated `main`:

```sh
git switch main
git pull --ff-only
uv sync --locked --group dev
uv run kubetrol
```

1. Type `:ns ` and part of a namespace. Select the suggestion with Up/Down and
   Enter. Check that its pods appear without reopening the namespace picker.
2. Select a pod and press Enter, including a pod with only one container.
   Select a container and press Enter again to read its logs.
3. Press Esc to return to containers, then Esc to return to the pod table.
   Check that the selection and viewport remain where you left them.
4. On pods, `d` still opens details and `l` still opens logs directly. In the
   container table, `j/k` and `g/G` navigate; Ctrl+Q quits.

Container names/types come from the selected pod snapshot; reopen to refresh.
Live container health and ephemeral container browsing remain later work.
Report whether namespace arrow/Enter selection and both returns work in your
terminal. See [behavior and limits](container-navigation.md) and
[measured acceptance evidence](acceptance/enter-navigation.md).

## Process and terminal foundation: S03

The shared local-process runner and native terminal adapter are implemented.
This backend checkpoint does not add a pod/container shell shortcut; S04 #32
provides that user-facing route and actual Kubernetes exec qualification.
Continue the pod/container/log trial above. Developers can run:

```sh
uv run pytest tests/unit/test_processes.py tests/contract/test_processes.py tests/unit/test_terminal_lease.py tests/ui/test_handoff.py tests/terminal/test_handoff.py
```

These tests use owned synthetic local programs and real PTYs, including keyboard
input, resize, Ctrl+C, repeated handoffs, startup failure, cancellation and parent
termination. No user kubeconfig or cluster is used. See the
[process/terminal contract](process-handoff.md) and
[measured acceptance evidence](acceptance/S03.md).


## Selected-container shell: #121 — current embedded trial

From an interactive terminal on merged `main`, with kubectl installed and a
kubeconfig you trust:

```sh
git switch main
git pull --ff-only
uv sync --locked --group dev
uv run kubetrol
```

1. Choose your context with `:ctx`, then `:ns YOUR_NAMESPACE`.
2. Select a running pod and press Enter. Choose its container with Up/Down.
3. Press `s` (or `x`). The shell opens **inside a full-screen Kubetrol frame**,
   with context, pod and container visible. Try `pwd`; resize the window and
   check that the frame stays visible. Ctrl+C interrupts the remote program.
4. Type `exit` or press Ctrl+] to close the shell. Check that the same container
   remains selected. Press Esc to
   return to the same pod and viewport.
5. Alternatively, `x`, `:shell` or `:exec` on pods opens the container picker.
   Enter on containers still opens logs; shell launch always requires `s`/`x`.

Read-only mode refuses shell execution. An image without `sh`, a stopped
container or denied pods/exec permission returns an actionable message. For a
different image shell, configure a YAML argument list such as
`shell: ["/bin/bash", "-l"]` and restart. The shell must exist in that image.
See [shell controls, requirements and limits](container-shell.md) and
[measured embedded-shell evidence](acceptance/embedded-shell.md).

For feedback, report whether the selected container is correct and whether
exit, resize and return preserve the table. No credentials or kubeconfig
contents are needed. Automated trials use owned fake APIs, actual PTYs and an
explicitly created/deleted kind cluster; they do not use your contexts.
